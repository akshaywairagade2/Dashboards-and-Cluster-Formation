Clusters were formed from the year 1960 because I needed the countries which have all the years in common.
Therefore, I discarded the countries which did not have data from 1960.

Plotly library was used for plotting the countries with their cluster values.
Dash library was used to plot in localhost.
We used TimeSeriesKMeans from tseries library for forming the Clusters
Data was normalized using the sklearn library.

co2_emission.py file contains the code for plotting of dashboard.
ipynb file contains all the processing of code and formation of dataframe clusters.csv for plotting in dash.
